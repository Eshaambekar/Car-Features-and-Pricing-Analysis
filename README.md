# 🚗 Car Features and Pricing Analysis

This project explores how different car features such as engine horsepower, fuel type, and body style influence a car's price (MSRP) and popularity.

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze what features influence car prices the most and provide insights for manufacturers and marketers.

## 🧠 Business Problem

Car makers often wonder: Are customers paying more for performance, fuel efficiency, or brand? This project aims to uncover these patterns using historical data.

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: Kaggle ("Car Features and MSRP")
- Records: ~11,000
- Features: Brand, Year, Engine HP, MPG, Popularity, MSRP, and more.

## 🧼 Data Cleaning

- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values (filled with averages or dropped)
- Created new columns like Average MPG

## 🛠 Tools & Tech Stack

- **Tool Used**: Microsoft Excel
- **Version**: Excel 2022
- **Features**: Pivot tables, AVERAGEIFS, COUNTIF, scatter plots, bubble charts, regression analysis

## 📊 Approach

- Used descriptive statistics and visualizations
- Built regression models to evaluate feature impact on price
- Conducted exploratory analysis on brand, style, and performance

## 📈 Key Insights

- Higher horsepower = higher price but lower fuel efficiency
- Convertibles and coupes are more expensive
- Brands like Tesla and Porsche top pricing
- Popularity varies widely and may affect MSRP

## 📌 Recommendations

- Focus on fuel-efficient models in mass-market segments
- Reserve high-performance features for luxury lines
- Monitor brand popularity trends

## 🔍 Limitations

- No resale value or location-based pricing
- Popularity not well-defined
- Basic regression only (Excel limitations)

## 🚀 Future Work

- Use Python or Power BI for deeper, automated analysis
- Compare MSRP vs actual selling price
- Include more advanced modeling
